# CPE142
This repository contains my final project for my computer engineering course CPE 142. This project was formed with a team of two one being myseld and the other being my friend. Since we were unable to complete the final cpu and cpu fixture with all the components, the inidividual components with there own testbenches named fixture were provided to ensure that they worked properly. This class truely gave me a better understanding on verilog and taught me MIPS architecture along with other CPU internal architecture concept. Grade recieved: B
